# Simple Image Gallery

A straightforward React image gallery with basic features. I created this as a project for GenY, my college club. It features a user-friendly interface for uploading, deleting, and viewing images. Feel free to explore and contribute!

## Features

- Upload images.
- Delete selected images.
- View images in a grid layout.
- Simple UI for ease of use.

## Journey

Originally started with Firebase as the backend, I encountered numerous challenges and errors. After much effort and troubleshooting, I decided to switch to local memory and leverage React Dropzone to bring this image gallery to life.
